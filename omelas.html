    <p>“The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” by Ursula K LeGuin has a lot of subtle concepts and messages it explores within the short work, but to me, <b>the most prominent message within the story is a warning of the consequences of normalization, and how horrific things can be justified as something necessary or normal.</b></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do you think a successful, prosperous society needs some sort of “necessary evil” to exist?</li>
        <li>Are there parts of your society that are considered normal but you consider immoral?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While plenty of people stay within Omelas, there are also, of course, the ones who walk away. Given the context and relative proximity to the reveal of the abused child, we can assume that the ones who walk away do so out of disgust for the town’s actions, leaving as a form of silent protest or rebellion.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do the ones who walk away actually have much impact on the town of Omelas itself? Why or why not?</li>
        <li>Why do you think none of the people who leave attempt to help rescue the child, or outright stop the cycle of abuse?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My personal answers to the questions above is that the cycle is systemic, and that while the ones who walk away wish for it to end, they as individuals find that they cannot change anything themselves, and that even if the child is helped, another will take their place, which can be understood as allegory for the inefficiency of change based on a singular person. While we never know the totals of the ones who walk away, we can assume that it is a larger number, and that collectively, a large enough resistance could end the cycle of abuse.</p>
    <p>Another major theme within “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” is the concept that suffering is necessary to create art. The narrator argues that there is a perception that only evil and pain are interesting, and that happiness is a silly concept, and attempts to refute this idea by presenting the town of Omelas as a happy place as complicated as any other society. However, we are later told that there is suffering present in the town, on one lone person, as seen on the child.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>What do you think the author is trying to convey with this juxtaposition?</li>
        <li>What about stories that use suffering to highlight moments of happiness? Or, possibly more relevant, vice versa? Does a mixing of emotions provide a more interesting piece of art?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Personally, I think that the inclusion of the child is very purposeful, and using the concept of opposite emotions enhancing the other. In a sea of happiness, a case of abuse is all the more acute and uncomfortable, and in a story of nothing but despair, a small bit of hope is all the more brighter.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Do you think there is hope for the child? Do you think someone will eventually save them and end the happiness of Omelas?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Also, since the themes are what I'd argue as somewhat relevant, I'm going to advertise Jacob Geller's video essay <a href="https://youtu.be/O2tXLsEUpaQ"></a>Every Zelda is the Darkest Zelda</a> here. issa good video essay :]</p>
