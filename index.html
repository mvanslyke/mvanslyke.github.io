 <p>(how the heck does anyone write a personal statement this sucks) Hello! I’m Madeline, a student my senior year at Willamette University who is about to graduate with a <strong>Data Science</strong> major and <strong>Data Scienc</strong> minor. I currently also work as a <strong>Web Development</strong> intern for the university, and have <strong>developed several small tools and interfaces</strong> for administrators to use.</p>
 <p>My hope is to continue into some sort of <strong>data-centric field</strong>, as my fondness lies with statistics. <strong>Visualization and probability</strong> are my strong points, but I am also very flexible, and am <strong>willing to pick up new skills</strong> that best suit the situation. </p>
 <p>Hi. I know you wanted this to be 140-280 but I would literally rather implode and become a singular molecule than attempt to talk positively about myself in this sort of dry, professional tone. How do I tell employers that my friends tell me that I have <strong>good vibes</strong>. That’s not a marketable aspect that employers are looking for.</p>
