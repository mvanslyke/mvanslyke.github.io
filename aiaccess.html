<p>AI is a field that a field I feel that we as a society need to be very careful about. <strong>While it can be incredibly useful to many, many people and increase accessibility, the harvesting of data for many AI models is morally dubious at best, and can lead to companies having even more unmitigated access to parts of our lives.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Where do you think it is safe to implement AI, and where can it be harmful?</li>
    <li>What kind of regulations do you think should be in place on AI technologies, if any at all?</li>
</ul>

<p>I personally think regulations in particular should be established, as there doesn’t seem to be much of a legal precedent for AI currently within our American system at this point in time, and such regulation, ideally somewhat stringent, should be put in place, especially considering how AI usage seems to becoming more and more prevalent by the day.</p>
<p>I find the discussion of the InnerVoice AI to be intriguing, and while I think it could be a valuable tool, there’s a concern that I have that could pushed as a replacement for educating teachers how to kindly and respectfully handle neurodivergent children in a learning environment. After all, there could be students who won’t use the app and would rather communicate via other means, and heavy reliance on 1 communication tool could cause problems in the future.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Do you think the people who developed the app discussed its features with autistic people?</li>
    <li>Do you think the development of this application could use the input of autistic people?</li>
</ul>

<p>While the creators of the app are listed as “Autism specialists”, there is no indication that either of them actually has autism. One of the executive officers has also previously associated with Autism Speaks, a foundation that is not exactly on good terms with the autistic community.</p>
<p>There’s also an interesting note in the latter part of the article about attempting to marketing neurodivergence to employers, and while I think it definitely its definitely worthwhile to help make employment easier for neurodivergent people and emphasize that they have worthwhile skills, I don’t see how this is related to AI beyond that neurodivergent people tend to do well in technological fields. There’s also an aspect I personally find disturbing in that people are forced to make every part of themselves palatable and marketable to scrape by, and have to justify often messy, personal conditions as something useful for a company, although I think that might just be the horrors of living under capitalism.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are there parts of the hiring process you think might cause bias against neurodivergent people?</li>
    <li>Are there parts of the hiring process you think are extraneous, overly complicated, or unnecessary to assessing a person’s value to a company? </li>
    <li>How would you handle the hiring process?</li>
</ul>
